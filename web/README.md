# Gel UI web app

Note: If you are just looking to use Gel UI, then you don't need to do any of
these steps, just run the `gel ui` command from your project directory.

## Development

> **Prerequisites**: You will need to have Yarn 2+ installed, and have run the
> `yarn` command to install the workspace's dependencies.

To start the UI dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

The app is served at `http://localhost:3002/ui`.

The Gel server needs to be run separately with `cors_allow_origins`
configured to allow the UI's `localhost:3002` origin:

```sh
edb server

# Only needs to be run once:
edb cli configure set cors_allow_origins '*'

```

To customize the Gel server address (if it's not running at the
default of `localhost:5656`):

```sh
env VITE_GEL_SERVER_URL="192.168.0.123:5656" yarn dev
```

## UI Tests

> **Prerequisites**: The UI tests use Selenium WebDriver to run tests on Chrome.
> You will need to have Chrome browser installed, and to have `chromedriver`
> installed and available in the system `PATH`.
>
> (Instructions to install `chromedriver`: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/#3-the-path-environment-variable)

To run the UI tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

If there is already an instance of an Gel dev server running on port 5656,
or the UI dev server running on port 3000, then they will be used by the tests.
If not (or the tests are running in CI), the test runner will start temporary
instances of them for the duration of the tests.

By default the tests run `chromedriver` in headless mode, but to see the
Chrome window during the tests (eg. for debugging), run with the `--no-headless`
flag:

```sh
yarn test --no-headless
```

### Writing tests

The tests use the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) framework, with a custom
environment that provides an already configured instance of the `WebDriver`
class as the global variable `driver`. The following common webdriver API's
are also exposed as global variables: `By`, `until`, `Key`.
